Goodbye-World
=============

The last program that every developer writes.

A "Goodbye World" program is a computer program that outputs "Goodbye World" (or some variant thereof) on a display device. Because it is a very simple and direct message, it is by tradition often used to illustrate the programmer's intentions to leave this world.
